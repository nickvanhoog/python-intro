python-intro
============

Some example scripts for the "Getting Started with Python" for ACM Teach in Spring 2013 at UCLA.

In the example scripts, I tried to contain Google-able terms in double quotes. I encourage 
anyone that's curious about such terms (e.g. list comprehensions, magic methods) to Google them!

I worked with Python 2.7.4.
